% uwmDiFo consists of 5 files (uwmDiFo.tex, uwmDiFo.bib, jf.bst, thesis-and-dissertation-formatting.pdf, jf.bst, and preferred_blk.eps).
% I wrote the main tex code (uwmDiFo.tex) and the corresponding bib code (uwmDiFo.bib) to be inserted.
% I downloaded and used the jf.bst file by Professor Richard H. Stanton (http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/stanton/texintro/).
% This is the guideline I followed (https://uwm.edu/graduateschool/wp-content/themes/uwmwebid-graduateschool/media/thesis-and-dissertation-formatting.pdf).
% The guideline includes a sample acknowledgement page by Doctor _________________ (___________________________)
% I downloaded and inserted the preferred_blk.eps (altered a space by an underscore) file by UWM (https://uwm.edu/branding/uwm-preferred-logo-downloads/).
% Margins are 1 inch. FRONTMATTER uses only one side, while MAINMATTER and APPENDIX use two sides.
% Compile pdfLaTeX, BibTeX, pdfLaTeX, and pdfLaTeX consecutively to complete
% Programming comments are attached right before each part with no line break

\noindent March, 2013 ProQuest states: We no longer have a word limit on your abstract, as this constrains your ability to describe your research in a section that is accessible to search engines, and therefore would constrain potential exposure of your work. However, we continue to publish print indexes that include citations and abstracts of all dissertations and theses published by ProQuest/UMI. These print indexes require limits of 350 words for doctoral dissertations and 150 words for master's theses. Additionally, our print indexes allow only text to be included in the abstract. In the editorial process for these print publications, we will simply truncate your abstract if it exceeds these word limits and remove any non-text content. You may wish to limit the length of your abstract if this concerns you. The abstract as you submit it will NOT be altered in your published manuscript. Please include an additional version of your abstract in English, even if the primary language of your dissertation or thesis is NOT English. For additional information regarding formatting of abstracts, please see the FAQ here: http://www.etdadmin.com/cgi-bin/main/faq?siteId=164\#ts10\par\end{singlespacing}
